# INTRODUCTION 
The project Student Report Management System is aimed to efficiently store and retrieve student reports.
This project in C++ is a simple console application built without any  graphical  Interface.  In  this  project,  users  can perform typical report card related functions like adding a new student record and displaying, modifying, editing and deleting it. File handling has been effectively used to perform all these. This project will teach you how to use file handling in C++, add, read, display, search, modify and delete record from file. 
1.  Create  student  report  card  record
2.  Read  all  students  report  card  record
3.  Read  specific  student’s  report  card  record
4.  Display all students’ grade report
5.  Modify  student’s  report  card  record
6.  Delete  student  record

# HEADER FILES USED
1. #include<iostream> :- It is used as a stream of Input and Output using cin and cout. 
2. #include<fstream.h> :- It is used to control the data to read from a file as an input and data to write into the file as an output. 
3. #include<iomanip> :- It is used  to access set() and  setprecision() function to limit the decimal places in variables.
4. #include <stdlib.h> :- The stdlib.h header defines four variable types,  several macros,  and  various  functions  for  performing  general functions.
