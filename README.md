# Student_Report_Management_System_project
this project, we can learn a lot about input/output streams and the file management system of C++. Our program collects student details like name, roll number, marks in each subject, and calculates their grade. This is a simple console app. Note that we focus only on the correct inputs in this project, and you can enhance it to handle wrong inputs.
